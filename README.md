# Notice
* `d3dcompiler_47.dll` included in the `engine/external/misc` folder is actually the `d3dcompiler_dxc_bridge.dll` released with DXC. This is necessary for the shader compiler to properly works because I use SM 6.
* Be aware that the `.vcproj` is manually edited with several customized build steps.
